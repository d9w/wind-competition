      <br/>

      <p>Wind farm design has long been an application domain for evolutionary learning
      and optimization due to the complexity of the design space, and the
      discontinuities in the search space caused by the wake effects that make it
      hard to optimize analytically. In recent years, with a need to increase the
      renewable energy portfolio, the existing wind farm layout approaches are being
      tested under a variety of scenarios. Newer models to evaluate layouts and newer
      constraints emerge demanding more sophistication from the algorithms.</p>

      <p>We propose the following competition to enable a basis of comparison
      for the existing algorithms and to encourage new ways to solve the wind
      optimization problem. As part of the competition, we will provide layout
      evaluators and conditions using which designers are expected to optimize and
      baseline performance for the different layout optimization problems. Users are
      expected to contribute to the open source library for wind farm layout
      optimization as part of this competition.</p>

      <h2>Competition Goals</h2>

      <p>This competition aims to bring more realistic problems to algorithm
      developers, and to create an open source environment useful beyond the scope of
      this competition. Historically, stochastic search have been the best approaches
      to solving the wind farm layout optimization problem, and as the industry
      continues to develop new models, constraints, and situations, it is timely that
      we propose a method of integration of these tracks. This competition sets the
      stage for that integration. Here, we present an open source library for wind
      farm layout optimization with an API built to support any stochastic search
      algorithm. We hope to showcase the state of the art algorithms on a platform
      where the industry can bring their layout evaluation models. Furthermore, by
      focusing the problem parameters, we will create mechanisms for the type of
      uniform comparison that has been so far lacking in this field.</p>

    <div id="APIs" class="row titre">

      <h2>APIs and Interfaces</h2>

      <p>We will provide an API in C++, Java, and MATLAB for optimizers that
      interacts with our open source wind layout evaluation model, and a basic
      scenario consisting of sample wind data and wind farm geography and obstacles.
      Different implementations of the wake model besides the provided versions will
      have to be approved and validated in advance. An automated submission system
      will allow competitors to see their rank on a public leader board.</p>

      <br/>

      <p>More details will be posted here soon.</p>

      <h2>Competition Details</h2>

      <p>The competition goal will be split in two tracks:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><b>Fixed number of turbines.</b> The first track tackles the
        problem the most common in the wind energy community. The aim is to
        optimization of the energy capture of a layout given a fixed number of
        turbines.</li>

        <li><b>Variable number of turbines.</b> The aim of this track is to
        implant as much as turbines in a layout given a minimum wake free ratio
        (the output energy over the theoretical output energy of the layout).
        This problem can be expanded to evaluate the benefit of adding a
        turbine to a field based on local constraints such as price and
        cabling, provides a more realistic challenge.</li>

      </ul>

      <br/>

      <p>The competition schedule is tentatively as follows:</p>

      <br/>

      <p><b>March 15, 2014:</b> Provided layouts and wake model code online</p>
      <p><b>April 1, 2014:</b> Automated submission system and live leader board online</p>
      <p><b>June 1, 2014:</b> Final submission deadline</p>

    </div>

    <div id="evaluations" class="row titre">

      <h2>Evaluations</h2>

      <p>During the competition, contestants will be given:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>a set of 5 completely new scenarios and layouts to optimize,</li>

        <li>5000 layout evaluations (usually the most computational part of the
        optimization) for the 5 layouts to optimize (the stop criterion of the
        algorithm will be therefore another challenge).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Competitors will be allowed to enter either or both tracks and
      rankings and prizes will be given for each track. They will be compared
      on each layout to optimize according to the energy output for the first
      track and the number of turbines implanted on the second track (and
      energy output for ex-aequo) and ranked with point system:

      <ul>
        <li>10 points given to the best approach</li>
        <li>6 points given to the second best approach</li>
        <li>4 points to the third</li>
        <li>3 points to the forth</li>
        <li>2 points to the fifth</li>
        <li>1 point to the sixth</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The winner of each track will be the one with the maximum of points.</p>

      <p>The optimizer, with a compilation and/or execution readme file, will
      have to be submitted on this website. The optimizer must be compatible
      with a standard linux machine. The arguments of the programs are the list
      of XML scenario file names and associated the number of turbine to
      opmitize for the fixed number of turbine track or the minimal wake free
      ratio for the variable number of turbine track. The optimizer must
      display for each layout generated:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the number of evaluations used to produce the layout,</li>
        <li>the energy output of the final layout,</li>
        <li>the number of turbines used on the layout.</li>
      </ul>
